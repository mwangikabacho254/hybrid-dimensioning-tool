Key Features
🔹 Triple-Sensor Technology: Combines ultrasonic distance measurement (0.02m–4m), angle detection (0°–90°), and laser targeting. - 
🔹 Real-Time Calculations: Computes vertical heights, spans, and object dimensions using trigonometric models. 
🔹 Cloud Integration: Automatically logs field data into Google Sheets for easy digital record keeping. 
🔹 Rugged Design: Battery-powered for portability and durable performance in harsh outdoor conditions.
